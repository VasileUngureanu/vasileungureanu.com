_This post is part of a series of posts with my personal notes about the chapters in the book [Agile Technical Practices Distilled](https://leanpub.com/agiletechnicalpracticesdistilled). I do, however, strongly recommend reading the book to get the full benefit out of it._

Hi!

Here are the notes that I took for you (and me) from the chapter.

* Pair programming is about shortening the feedback loop when writing code.
* Pair programming requires a high level of maturity from peers.
* Pair programming should be a choice, not an enforced practice.
* In pair programming, each person takes a turn assuming one of these roles:

  * Driver – Responsible for the coding work.
  * Navigator – Responsible for reviewing the driver’s work.
 
* Pair programming encourages participants to switch roles often. There are a few techniques you can use to encourage this:

  * Chess clock
  * Ping Pong/Popcorn.
  * Strong-style pairing.

* Remember to have breaks when you are working and especially when pairing. You can use the “Pomodoro” technique.
