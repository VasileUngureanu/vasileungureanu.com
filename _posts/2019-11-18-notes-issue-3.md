Hi!

Here are the latest notes that I took for you (and me). 

### Articles

[Rethinking Pair Programming](https://codurance.com/2015/03/15/rethinking-pair-programming/)

* Pair programming can be slow and frustrating because of long debates that can occur, but we can improve it by bringing the whole team to the same level of understanding.
* Pair programming can be very tiring when spending the whole day pairing, but we can improve it by taking regular breaks and let developers work some time alone.
* Pair programming ca stifle creativity, it should be OK for any team member to express her desire to work on a task alone.
* Inexperienced developers will benefit more from pairing if they would be left alone to do their own research and make their own mistakes.
* As a team, agree on a time interval to have your “pairing hours”.

* TDD leads to better code quality.
* TDD leads to better design.
* TDD works well only if developers are experienced with this development approach.
* TDD is in many ways pleasant and convenient to developers.
* With TDD, you save a lot of time.
* TDD may not work in legacy codebases where code is hard to test.
* TDD leads to fewer bugs.
* TDD acts like a “safety net” when performing the refactoring.
* TDD helps to better understand the domain.
* Tests make great developer-friendly technical documentation.
* Less waste time on manual testing.
* TDD allows for continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.

[6 Misconceptions about TDD – Part 2. We all understand Key Laws of TDD in the same way](https://www.thedroidsonroids.com/blog/key-laws-of-tdd)

* Two rules of TDD by Kent Beck:
  1. Don’t write a line of new code unless you first have a failing automated test.
  1. Eliminate duplication.

* The Three Laws of TDD by Uncle Bob:
  1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
  1. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test that is sufficient to fail, and compilation failures are failures.
  1. You are not allowed to write any more production code that is sufficient to pass the one failing the unit test.

* Three rules of TDD by Martin Fowler:
  1. Write a test for the next bit of functionality you want to add.
  1. Write the functional code until the test passes.
  1. Refactor both new and old code to make it well structured.

* Guidelines:
  * We should not mix the Green and Refactoring phase of TDD-cycle.
  * We really need to refactor the code immediately after the Green phase.
  * Write only one failing test at once.
  * Prefer taking smaller steps than bigger ones.

[6 Misconceptions about TDD – Part 4. There is one right granularity of steps](https://www.thedroidsonroids.com/blog/6-misconceptions-about-tdd-part-4-steps-size)

* The size of steps is often related to the confidence we have in the codebase and our understanding of the domain.
* The size of steps in TDD can influence the final design we implement.
* There are is no one correct size of steps in TDD. We should take factors like confidence in the codebase, domain knowledge, design, architecture and probably other factors into account.

[Test Desiderata](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-desiderata-94150638a4b3)

* A test should exhibit most of these properties:
  * Isolated — tests should return the same results regardless of the order in which they are run.
  * Composable — if tests are isolated, then I can run 1 or 10 or 100 or 1,000,000 and get the same results.
  * Fast — tests should run quickly.
  * Inspiring — passing the tests should inspire confidence.
  * Writable — tests should be cheap to write relative to the cost of the code being tested.
  * Readable — tests should be comprehensible for the reader, invoking the motivation for writing this particular test.
  * Behavioral — tests should be sensitive to changes in the behavior of the code under test. If the behavior changes, the test result should change.
  * Structure-insensitive — tests should not change their result if the structure of the code changes.
  * Automated — tests should run without human intervention.
  * Specific — if a test fails, the cause of the failure should be obvious.
  * Deterministic — if nothing changes, the test result shouldn’t change.
  * Predictive — if the tests all pass, then the code under test should be suitable for production.
