_This post is part of a series of posts with my personal notes on content related to Technical Blogging.

Taking notes helps a lot in my learning process, also it's useful to reread them occasionally in order to refresh my knowledge._

Hi!

Here are the latest notes that I took for you (and me):

[You Need a Blog](https://www.donnfelker.com/you-need-a-blog/)

You need a Blog because it will help you to make more money by increasing exposure.

[Why Every Professional Should Consider Blogging](https://technicalblogging.com/why-every-professional-should-consider-blogging/)

Every professional should consider Blogging because it can:
  * Improve your communication skills.
  * Improve your technical skills.
  * Provide you with a repository for your knowledge.
  * Help make powerful connections.
  * Help you make friends.
  * Provide you with a second income.
  * Score your freebies.
  * Advance your career.
  * Make you popular in your field.
  * Help you reach and teach a wide audience.

[Finding Time to Blog](https://technicalblogging.com/finding-time-to-blog/)

* “I don’t have time” is a lie, you have the same amount of time as the most brilliant and prolific people you can think of.
* You should prioritize work such as blogging that helps you hit your goals.
* What gets scheduled gets done.
* Jot new ideas for additional posts into a file (paper or digital).

[Why You Should Start a Blog Right Now](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/)

* It doesn't matter if nobody will read your blog.

* Blog posts are not necessary to be original.
* Unoriginal writing is useful because it helps discover and learn new things.
* Writing is hard but it will get easier with experience.
