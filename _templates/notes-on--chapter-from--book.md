_This post is part of a series of posts with my personal notes on books that I read.
<br />
Taking notes helps a lot in my learning process, also it's useful to reread them occasionally in order to refresh my knowledge.
<br />
I do, however, strongly recommend reading the book to get the full benefit out of it.

Hi!

Here are the notes that I took for you (and me) from the chapter.
