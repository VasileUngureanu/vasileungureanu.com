            <p><em>This post is part of a series of posts with my personal notes on books that I read.
<br />
Taking notes helps a lot in my learning process, also it’s useful to reread them occasionally in order to refresh my knowledge.
<br />
I do, however, strongly recommend reading the book to get the full benefit out of it.

<p>Hi!</p>

<p>Here are the notes that I took for you (and me) from the book.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The purpose of software is to help people.</li>
  <li>It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation.</li>
  <li>The longer your program exists, the more probable it is that any piece of it will have to change.</li>
  <li>The chance of introducing a defect into your program is proportional to the size of the changes you make to it.</li>
  <li>The ease of maintenance of any piece of software is proportional to the simplicity of its individual pieces.</li>
  <li>The degree to which you know how your software behaves is the degree to which you have accurately tested it.</li>
  <li>The effort of maintenance is proportional to the complexity of the system.</li>
  <li>The difference between a bad programmer and a good programmer is understanding. That is, bad programmers don’t understand what they are doing, and good programmers do.</li>
  <li>A “good programmer” should do everything in his power to make what he writes as simple as possible to other programmers.</li>
  <li>A program is:
    <ul>
      <li>A sequence of instructions given to the computer.</li>
      <li>The actions taken by a computer as the result of being given instructions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Anything that involves the architecture of your software system or the technical decisions you make while creating the system falls under the category of “software design.”</li>
  <li>Everybody who writes software is a designer.</li>
  <li>Design is not a democracy. Decisions should be made by individuals.</li>
  <li>There are laws of software design, they can be known, and you can know them. They are eternal, unchanging, and fundamentally true, and they work.</li>
  <li>The goals of software design are:
    <ul>
      <li>To allow us to write software that is as helpful as possible.</li>
      <li>To allow our software to continue to be as helpful as possible.</li>
      <li>To design systems that can be created and maintained as easily as possible by their programmers, so that they can be—and continue to be—as helpful as possible.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The quality level of your design should be proportional to the length of future time in which your system will continue to help people.</li>
  <li>There are some things about the future that you do not know.</li>
  <li>The most common and disastrous error that programmers make is predicting something about the future when in fact they cannot know.</li>
  <li>You are safest if you don’t attempt to predict the future at all, and instead make all your design decisions based on immediately known present-time information.</li>
  <li>The three mistakes (called “the three flaws” in this book) that software designers are prone to making in coping with the Law of Change are:
    <ul>
      <li>Writing code that isn’t needed.</li>
      <li>Not making the code easy to change.</li>
      <li>Being too generic.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Don’t write code until you actually need it, and remove any code that isn’t being used.</li>
  <li>Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future.</li>
  <li>When your design actually makes things more complex instead of simplifying things, you’re overengineering.</li>
  <li>Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now.</li>
  <li>You can avoid the three flaws by doing incremental development and design.</li>
  <li>The best design is the one that allows for the most change in the environment with the least change in the software.</li>
  <li>Never “fix” anything unless it’s a problem, and you have evidence showing that the problem really exists.</li>
  <li>In any particular system, any piece of information should, ideally, exist only once.</li>
  <li>The ease of maintenance of any piece of software is proportional to the simplicity of its individual pieces.</li>
  <li>Simplicity is relative.`</li>
  <li>If you really want to succeed, it is best to be stupid, dumb simple.</li>
  <li>Be consistent.</li>
  <li>Readability of code depends primarily on how space is occupied by letters and symbols.</li>
  <li>Names should be long enough to fully communicate what something is or does without being so long that they become hard to read.</li>
  <li>Comments should explain why the code is doing something, not what it is doing.</li>
  <li>Simplicity requires design.</li>
  <li>You can create complexity by:
    <ul>
      <li>Expanding the purpose of your software.</li>
      <li>Adding programmers to the team.</li>
      <li>Changing things that don’t need to be changed.</li>
      <li>Being locked into bad technologies.</li>
      <li>Misunderstanding.</li>
      <li>Poor design or no design.</li>
      <li>Reinventing the wheel.</li>
      <li>Violating the purpose of your software.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You can determine whether or not a technology is “bad” by looking at its survival potential, interoperability, and attention to quality.</li>
  <li>Often, if something is getting very complex, that means there is an error in the design somewhere below the level where the complexity appears.</li>
  <li>When presented with complexity, ask, “What problem are you trying to solve?”</li>
  <li>Most difficult design problems can be solved by simply drawing or writing them out on paper.</li>
  <li>To handle complexity in your system, redesign the individual pieces in small steps.</li>
  <li>The key question behind all valid simplifications is, “How could this be easier to deal with or more understandable?”</li>
  <li>If you run into an unfixable complexity outside of your program, put a wrapper around it that is simple for other programmers.</li>
  <li>Rewriting is acceptable only in a very limited set of situations.</li>
  <li>Unless you’ve tried it, you don’t know that it works.</li>
</ul>
