_This post is part of a series of posts with my personal notes on articles I study, talks I watch and podcasts I listen.
<br />
Taking notes helps a lot in my learning process, also it's useful to reread them occasionally in order to refresh my knowledge._

Hi!

Here are the latest notes that I took for you (and me).

### Articles

[Comments should be sentences](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201401/comments_should_be_sentences.html)

* Start the comment with a capital and end with a period.
{% highlight markdown %}

# BAD:
# try to read the thing

# BETTER:
# Try to read the thing.

# EVEN BETTER:
# Try to read the configuration file, but it's OK if
# it's missing because we don't require a config file.

{% endhighlight %}

[//TODO: Write a better comment](https://dev.to/adammc331/todo-write-a-better-comment-4c8c)

* Remove comments you don't actually need.
* Rewrite code to remove comments if we can.
* Make sure the remaining comments are helpful:
  * This is done by clarifying _why_, providing examples, or being actionable.
