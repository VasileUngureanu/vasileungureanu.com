Hi!

Here are the latest notes that I took for you (and me). 

### Articles

[Comments should be sentences](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201401/comments_should_be_sentences.html)

* Start the comment with a capital and end with a period.
{% highlight markdown %}

# BAD:
# try to read the thing

# BETTER:
# Try to read the thing.

# EVEN BETTER:
# Try to read the configuration file, but it's OK if
# it's missing because we don't require a config file.

{% endhighlight %}

[//TODO: Write a better comment](https://dev.to/adammc331/todo-write-a-better-comment-4c8c)

* Remove comments you don't actually need.
* Rewrite code to remove comments if we can.
* Make sure the remaining comments are helpful:
  * This is done by clarifying _why_, providing examples, or being actionable.

### Talks

### Podcasts

_The idea of ​​taking notes came to me when I discovered [in.snippets(): TL;DR for engineers](https://insnippets.appsmith.com/)._
