Hi!

Here are the latest notes that I took for you (and me). 

### Articles

### Talks

### Books

[Agile Technical Practices Distilled: CLASSIC TDD I – TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT](https://leanpub.com/agiletechnicalpracticesdistilled)

* Practicing TDD allows you to:

  * Spend less time debugging code to prove that it works.
  * Reduce the fear of changing code.
  * Use tests as living documentation.
  * Use tests as a feedback loop for design decisions.
  
* The three laws of TDD:

  1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
  1. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test that is sufficient to fail, and compilation failures are failures.
  1. You are not allowed to write any more production code that is sufficient to pass the one failing the unit test.

* Extract duplication only when you see it for the third time.  

### Podcasts

_The idea of ​​taking notes came to me when I discovered [in.snippets(): TL;DR for engineers](https://insnippets.appsmith.com/)._
